# Optim

Just a repo to store some python tools I'm occasionally using.

Partitioning:

Takes a wall length A and B as well as a minimum 
furniture door length to fill those length. 

Finds the optimum door width to cover those two length 
with a minimum difference between the door width on A and the door 
width on B.
